# AdventJs
## Every day a new challenge!
Starts on December 1 and until December 25, every day, a new challenge for you to solve with JavaScript. Compete with your friends!

## Frequent questions
What is an advent?
Although it has its roots in the Catholic religion, Advent has become a tradition where children got chocolate for 4 weeks, one per day, from December 1 to 24.

## Where do I find the source code?
Currently the source code is not available. It is a project that I have done in a very short time and it is still in the development phase. I will try to open the source code in the future. In the meantime, if you find a bug, you can leave an issue in this repository.

## Is this an original idea?
Since 2015, the Advent Of Code has been celebrated, which brings programming challenges every day. In this case, the challenges are intended to be solved with JavaScript.

## It's free?
Yes, playing Advent is completely free. From December 1 to 25 you will have a new JavaScript challenge.
